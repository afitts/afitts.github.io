Hello UNIVERSE. This is Alex Fitts reporting in. 

This space will serve as a hub for all the data science and programming projects I plan to embark on. I may occaisionally dip into astronomy, as is my nature, but hopefully I can find a wonderful marriage between the two. But who knows what we will find out there? Our only choice to venture forth and find out!
