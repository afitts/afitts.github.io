Iâ€™m an Austin-based graduate student working on my PhD in astrophysics at [The University of Texas at Austin](http://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/). I simulate dwarf galaxies in the field to gain a better understanding of galaxy formation at the low mass end. My research aims to address the inconsistencies that arise between dark matter only simulations and observations of dwarf galaxies. These isolated, small galaxies also provide the perfect laboratory to study the early universe and my hope is to utilize my simulations to gain insight into the specifics of reionization.     

Previously, I received my Master's degree in astronomy from [The University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.astro.umd.edu), where I worked on time-varying signals in accretion disk simulations. I was awarded my bachelor's in Physics from [The University of Connecticut](http://physics.uconn.edu) where I completed an undergraduate thesis by creating a spatial distribution computer model of a cometary atmosphere to study photo-desorption. 

Given that my simulations have gone from lowly cometary atmospheres to simulating the majority of the universe, I've become more and more interested in ways to tease out meaningful information from large amounts of data. This website serves as a foundation for all my thoughts and progress related to this pursuit. Sometimes I'll post about astornomy, sometimes I'll post about data science. We'll see how it goes!
