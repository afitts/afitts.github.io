Already a number of specific improvements that I could apply to my code have jumped out at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these improvements is the use of classes. I've incorporated defining fuctions into my codes but the use of classes would further streamline (and better modularize) the various scripts I currently use for analysis.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hello Universe</title><link href="http://localhost:8000/2016/06/10/hello-world/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><author><name>Alex Fitts</name></author><id>tag:localhost:8000,2016-06-10:2016/06/10/hello-world/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello UNIVERSE. This is Alex Fitts reporting in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This space will serve as a hub for all the data science and programming projects I plan to embark on. I may occaisionally dip into astronomy, as is my nature, but hopefully I can find a wonderful marriage between the two. But who knows what we will find out there? Our only choice to venture forth and find out!  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
